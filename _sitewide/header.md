As a producer for&nbsp;[PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs](https://studentreportinglabs.org/){: target="_blank"}, I work with high school students and teachers around the U.S. to develop the next generation of informed media creators and consumers. Previously, I spent six years as the Harrisburg reporter for&nbsp;[StateImpact Pennsylvania](https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/author/mariecusick/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;covering energy and environmental issues for PBS and NPR member stations. I got my start in public media in 2011 covering science and technology for WMHT in Albany, NY.
